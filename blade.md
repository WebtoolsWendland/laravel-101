# Blade

## Blade Templating

Blade is a simple, yet powerful templating engine provided with Laravel. Unlike controller layouts, Blade is driven by _template inheritance_ and _sections_. All Blade templates should use the `.blade.php` extension.

### Defining A Blade Layout

	<!-- Stored in app/views/layouts/master.blade.php -->

	<html>
		<body>
			@section('sidebar')
				This is the master sidebar.
			@show

			<div class="container">
				@yield('content')
			</div>
		</body>
	</html>

### Using A Blade Layout

	@extends('layouts.master')

	@section('sidebar')
		@parent

		<p>This is appended to the master sidebar.</p>
	@stop

	@section('content')
		<p>This is my body content.</p>
	@stop

Note that views which `extend` a Blade layout simply override sections from the layout. Content of the layout can be included in a child view using the `@parent` directive in a section, allowing you to append to the contents of a layout section such as a sidebar or footer.

Sometimes, such as when you are not sure if a section has been defined, you may wish to pass a default value to the `@yield` directive. You may pass the default value as the second argument:

	@yield('section', 'Default Content')

### Stacking Section

You can use `@push` and `@stack` to combine multiple snippet (useful for JavaScript or Widget).

	@push('footer.script')
	<script>
	jQuery(function ($) {
	$('.date').datepicker();
	});
	</script>
	@endpush

Make sure the name of you "stack" does not clash with available section name.

	@stack('footer.script')

## Other Blade Control Structures

### Echoing Data

	Hello, {{{ $name }}}.

	The current UNIX timestamp is {{{ time() }}}.

### Echoing Raw Data

	Hello, {!! $name !!}
	
	The current UNIX timestamp is {!! time() !!}

### Echoing Data After Checking For Existence

Sometimes you may wish to echo a variable, but you aren't sure if the variable has been set. Basically, you want to do this:

	{{{ isset($name) ? $name : 'Default' }}}

However, instead of writing a ternary statement, Blade allows you to use the following convenient short-cut:

	{{{ $name or 'Default' }}}

### Displaying Raw Text With Curly Braces

If you need to display a string that is wrapped in curly braces, you may escape the Blade behavior by prefixing your text with an `@` symbol:

	@{{ This will not be processed by Blade }}

Of course, all user supplied data should be escaped or purified. To escape the output, you may use the triple curly brace syntax:

	Hello, {{{ $name }}}.

If you don't want the data to be escaped, you may use double curly-braces:

	Hello, {{ $name }}.

> **Note:** Be very careful when echoing content that is supplied by users of your application. Always use the triple curly brace syntax to escape any HTML entities in the content.

### If Statements

	@if (count($records) === 1)
		I have one record!
	@elseif (count($records) > 1)
		I have multiple records!
	@else
		I don't have any records!
	@endif

	@unless (Auth::check())
		You are not signed in.
	@endunless

### Loops

	@for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++)
		The current value is {{ $i }}
	@endfor

	@foreach ($users as $user)
		<p>This is user {{ $user->id }}</p>
	@endforeach

	@forelse($users as $user)
	  	<li>{{ $user->name }}</li>
	@empty
	  	<p>No users</p>
	@endforelse

	@while (true)
		<p>I'm looping forever.</p>
	@endwhile

### Including Sub-Views

	@include('view.name')

You may also pass an array of data to the included view:

	@include('view.name', array('some'=>'data'))

### Looping Sub-Views

A common way to approach this in Blade could be to do something like this:

	@if (count($records))
	@foreach ($records as $record)
		@include('record.item', $record)
	@endforeach
	@else
		@include('record.no-items')
	@endif

Sure that works but kind of gross with all the nesting and in the wild Iâ€™ve seen code like this become unwieldily. To help make this cleaner Blade includes an often overlooked `@each()` option. Here is how that same code could be rewritten.

	// record/list.blade.php
	<ul>
		@each('record.item', $records, 'record', 'record.no-items')
	</ul>

	// record/item.blade.php
	<li>{{ $record->title }}</li>

	// record/no-items.blade.php
	<li>Sorry Charlie, No posts here.</li>

### Overwriting Sections

To overwrite a section entirely, you may use the `overwrite` statement:

	@extends('list.item.container')

	@section('list.item.content')
		<p>This is an item of type {{ $item->type }}</p>
	@overwrite

### Displaying Language Lines

	@lang('language.line')

	@choice('language.line', 1)

### Comments

## Extending Blade

Blade even allows you to define your own custom control structures. When a Blade file is compiled, each custom extension is called with the view contents, allowing you to do anything from simple `str_replace` manipulations to more complex regular expressions.

The Blade compiler comes with the helper methods `createMatcher` and `createPlainMatcher`, which generate the expression you need to build your own custom directives.

The `createPlainMatcher` method is used for directives with no arguments like `@endif` and `@stop`, while `createMatcher` is used for directives with arguments.

The following example creates a `@datetime($var)` directive which simply calls `->format()` on `$var`:

	Blade::extend(function($view, $compiler)
	{
		$pattern = $compiler->createMatcher('datetime');

		return preg_replace($pattern, '$1<?php echo $2->format(\'m/d/Y H:i\'); ?>', $view);
	});
